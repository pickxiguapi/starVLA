# Auto Evaluation Scripts

This folder contains the scripts we use internally to run quick evaluations across every task.
A fully automated run depends on our in-house platform setup, so the scripts may not work unchanged on your own infrastructure.
Please treat them as references and consult `run_policy_server.sh` and `start_simpler_env.sh` for the underlying workflow.
