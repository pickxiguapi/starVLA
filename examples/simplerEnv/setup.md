# 🚀 Eval SimplerEnv

This document provides instructions for reproducing our **experimental results** with SimplerEnv.  
The evaluation process consists of two main parts:  

1. Setting up the `simpler_env` environment and dependencies.  
2. Running the evaluation by launching services in both `internvla_m1` and `simpler_env` environments.  

We have verified that this workflow runs successfully on both **NVIDIA A100** and **RTX 4090** GPUs.

## ⬇️ 0. Download Checkpoints
First, download the checkpoints from [InternVLA-M1](https://huggingface.co/InternRobotics/InternVLA-M1)



## 📦 1. Environment Setup

To set up the environment, please first follow the official [SimplerEnv repository](https://github.com/simpler-env/SimplerEnv) to install the base `simpler_env` environment.  

Afterwards, inside the `simpler_env` environment, install the following dependencies:  

```bash
pip install tyro matplotlib mediapy websockets msgpack
pip install numpy==1.24.4
```

⚠️ **Common Issues**
When testing SimplerEnv on NVIDIA A100, you may encounter the following error:
`libvulkan.so.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory`
You can refer to this link to fix: [Installation Guide – Vulkan Section](https://maniskill.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/getting_started/installation.html#vulkan)

## 🚀 2. Evaluation Workflow

The evaluation should be run **from the repository root** using **two separate terminals**, one for each environment:  

- **internvla_m1 environment**: runs the inference server.  
- **simpler_env environment**: runs the simulation.  

### Step 1. Start the server (internvla_m1 environment)

In the first terminal, activate the `internvla_m1` conda environment and run:  

```bash
bash examples/Eval_simplenv_clean/start_server.sh
```

⚠️ **Note:** Please ensure that you specify the correct checkpoint path in  
`examples/Eval_simplenv_clean/start_server.sh`  


---

### Step 2. Start the simulation (simpler_env environment)

In the second terminal, activate the `simpler_env` conda environment and run:  

```bash
export PYTHONPATH=$(pwd):$PYTHONPATH
bash examples/Eval_simplenv_clean/start_simpler_env.sh
```
This script will automatically launch the WidowX Robot evaluation tasks, reproducing the benchmark results reported above.

⚠️ **Note:** Please ensure that you specify the correct rgb_overlay_path in  
`examples/Eval_simplenv_clean/start_simpler_env.sh`
